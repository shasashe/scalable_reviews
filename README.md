Fake Review Detector

This project is designed to identify fake reviews using machine learning and natural language processing. It takes user reviews as input and predicts whether the review is genuine or fake. The goal is to improve trust in online platforms by filtering out misleading or overly positive reviews that are not real.

The model is trained using a dataset of labeled reviews. Text preprocessing techniques are used to clean the data, and features are extracted using methods like TF-IDF. Then, a machine learning algorithm is used to classify the reviews.

The project is built using Python and libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and NLTK or spaCy for text processing.

To run the project, the user sets up a virtual environment, installs the required packages, and runs the main Python script. The program will then take review data and show whether each review is likely to be genuine or fake.

This project is simple, practical, and useful for businesses or platforms that want to maintain the authenticity of customer feedback.
